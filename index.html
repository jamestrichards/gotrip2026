      <h2>Thank You</h2>
      <p>I am deeply grateful for everyone who has chosen to pray, give, and encourage me as I prepare for the Las Vegas Go Trip. This journey is about more than travel, its about carrying the message of Christ to people that need His love. Your support reminds me that ministry is never a solo effort but a partnership in faith and purpose. Thank you for believing in this mission and helping make it possible through your generosity and prayers.</p>

      <h2>Ways to Support</h2>
      <p>There are several ways you can help make this ministry trip possible. Prayer is the foundation of everything we do, and I would be deeply thankful for your prayers over the team, the people we will meet, and the impact of our outreach. Financial giving is another meaningful way to join in this mission, helping cover travel and ministry expenses as we serve in Las Vegas. Whether you give, pray, or share this trip with others, your support plays a crucial part in what God is doing through this opportunity.</p>
